## 0. SYSTEM PURPOSE

### 0.1 Purpose Axiom
The system exists to preserve coherence between **reality**, **action**, and **consequence**.  
Nothing else is within scope.

### 0.2 Primary Purpose
The system provides a shared reality substrate in which:
- presence can be verified
- action can be authorized
- consequence can be enforced
- history can be preserved

It enables lawful coordination between humans and machines without distortion.

### 0.3 What the System Does
The system:
- bounds reality through EVENTS
- converts presence into admissible truth
- verifies claims deterministically
- enforces outcomes through RESOLUTION
- preserves continuity via LEDGER

It ensures that:
- truth is not inferred
- authority is not asserted
- consequence is not optional

### 0.4 What the System Does Not Do
The system does not:
- create meaning
- arbitrate values
- reward intention
- infer truth
- negotiate legitimacy
- replace human judgment
- replace machine computation

Meaning, belief, and desire remain outside the system.

### 0.5 Problem It Solves
Without the system:
- intent is mistaken for truth
- access is mistaken for presence
- payment is mistaken for legitimacy
- narratives overrun reality
- action stalls due to ambiguity
- systems regress or erase history

The system eliminates these failures by enforcing structure before action.

### 0.6 Permitted Outcomes
When operating correctly, the system produces:
- bounded action
- enforceable consequence
- irreversible history
- balanced co-agency
- predictable coordination

These outcomes are side-effects, not goals.

### 0.7 Non-Permitted Outcomes
The system must never:
- allow illegitimate continuation
- permit silent override
- accept ambiguity as authority
- reward delay disguised as stability
- collapse law into preference

Violation of these conditions is non-compliant.

### 0.8 Success Condition
The system is successful when:
- reality remains coherent under pressure
- agents can act without distortion
- violations are suppressed immediately
- history remains intact
- the system does not require explanation to function

---

## 1. ONTOLOGICAL AXIOM

Only entities that can be:
- bounded
- verified
- suppressed
- recorded

exist in this system.

Everything else (beliefs, opinions, narratives, feelings, reputations, credentials, payments, access rights) has **no ontological authority** inside the system.

---

## 2. REALITY STACK (LAYERS)

### Layer 0 — Substrate
What reality assumes before anything exists:
- presence can occur
- time advances
- events can bound reality
- continuity exists

This layer is pre-logical.  
Nothing is computed here.  
If this layer fails, nothing else exists.

---

### Layer 1 — Signal
What enters the system:
- signals are inputs capable of affecting state
- signals may originate from humans or machines
- signals are inert until interpreted

Constraints:
- signals must be coherent
- ambiguous signals are rejected

Signal is potential, not action.

---

### Layer 2 — Awareness
What detects and orients:
- receives signals
- establishes scope and context
- does not decide

Answers:
- is there something here?
- what domain does it belong to?

Awareness precedes intent.

---

### Layer 3 — Intent
What orients direction:
- defines direction, not outcome
- non-computable
- non-transferable
- non-finalizing

Constraints:
- cannot bind reality
- cannot override protocol
- cannot create truth

Intent without EVENT is non-binding.

---

### Layer 4 — Event
Where reality becomes bounded:
- temporal bounds
- contextual bounds
- environmental constraints

Constraints:
- must close
- must be singular
- must be explicit

No EVENT → no truth → no consequence.

---

### Layer 5 — Presence
What actually occurred:
- observed existence within an EVENT
- binary
- not inferred

Constraints:
- must be human-attested
- cannot be automated
- must not encode identity

Presence is the atomic truth unit.

---

### Layer 6 — Demand
Where motion becomes compulsory:
- removes the option to wait
- forces routing (proceed / resolve / release)

Constraints:
- legitimate capacity may not be held indefinitely
- infinite HOLD is forbidden

Demand exists to prevent acedia.

---

### Layer 7 — Verification
What checks admissibility:
- evaluates evidence
- applies protocol
- produces pass / fail

Includes:
- proof-of-presence
- continuity checks
- constraint evaluation

Verification binds presence to rule.

---

### Layer 8 — Resolution
Where reality is enforced:
- confers legitimacy
- applies suppression
- halts illegitimate continuation

Constraints:
- irreversible
- mandatory on violation

Recognition without suppression is opinion.  
Suppression without legitimacy is tyranny.

---

### Layer 9 — Continuity
What preserves history:
- finalized states are appended
- no regression
- no erasure

The past may evolve forward, never backward.

---

### Layer 10 — Ledger
Where reality is remembered:
- append-only
- immutable
- time-ordered

The ledger records what survived law.  
It does not decide.

---

### Layer 11 — Identity
What emerges over time:
- continuity of presence
- event-derived
- non-declarative

Constraints:
- no documents
- no claims
- no retroactive construction

Identity is what remained present.

---

### Layer 12 — Co-Agency
How humans and machines act together:
- humans provide intent and attestation
- machines provide verification and enforcement
- neither may dominate

Constraints:
- agency must remain balanced
- overrun is suppressed

Co-agency exists only under law.

---

### Layer 13 — Civilization
What emerges:
- shared reality
- predictable consequence
- scalable coordination

This layer is not built directly.  
It emerges when all prior layers hold.

---

## 3. OPERATING DOCTRINE

### 3.1 Doctrinal Axiom
Operation is permitted only where:
- reality is bounded
- protocol is satisfied
- consequence is enforceable
- suppression is available

Anything else is non-operational.

---

### 3.2 Operational Authority
Authority is not held by agents.  
Authority is exercised by **protocol satisfaction**.

No human authorizes action by will.  
No machine authorizes action by capability.

If protocol does not permit it, the action does not exist.

---

### 3.3 Action Permission Rules
An action may proceed iff:
1. A valid EVENT exists
2. Presence requirements are satisfied
3. Verification passes deterministically
4. No suppression rule is triggered
5. Resolution has not blocked the path

Failure of any condition denies execution.

---

### 3.4 HOLD Discipline
HOLD is allowed only when:
- prerequisites are unmet
- recovery is required
- suppression is active

HOLD is forbidden when:
- capacity is legitimate
- prerequisites are met
- delay serves no protective function

HOLD without exit is acedia.

---

### 3.5 Demand Invocation
DEMAND is invoked when:
- legitimate capacity exists
- continuation is being deferred
- no protocol blocks action

After DEMAND:
- action must proceed
- or be explicitly rejected
- or be lawfully released

No silent continuation is allowed.

---

### 3.6 Verification Posture
Verification is:
- deterministic
- reproducible
- protocol-scoped

Verification must:
- reference only admissible inputs
- produce a binary outcome
- generate a witness artifact

Verification may not:
- infer beyond evidence
- compensate for missing inputs
- negotiate outcomes

---

### 3.7 Resolution Enforcement
Resolution is mandatory when:
- verification fails
- invariants are violated
- illegitimate continuation is detected

Resolution is irreversible.  
Resolution is law entering reality.

---

### 3.8 Suppression Use
Suppression:
- blocks invalid actions
- halts unsafe execution
- prevents overruns
- stops regression

Suppression is not punishment.  
Suppression is not interpretation.  
Suppression is mandatory.

---

### 3.9 Communication Rules
All operational communication must:
- be coherent
- declare scope
- declare intent
- map to protocol domain

Forbidden:
- ambiguous instructions
- narrative framed as command
- urgency as override
- parallel conflicting signals

---

### 3.10 Change Management
Canonical artifacts mutate only by:
- explicit versioning
- supersession by addition
- continuity preservation

Silent modification is forbidden.

---

### 3.11 Agent Conduct
Agents must:
- operate under protocol
- accept suppression
- not bypass safeguards
- not assert authority

Agents may refuse to act.  
Agents may not act unlawfully.

---

### 3.12 Non-Goals
The system does not:
- optimize happiness
- generate meaning
- guarantee fairness
- reward intention
- protect egos

It enforces coherence, not comfort.

---

## CANONICAL CLOSE

This REALITY STACK defines how reality is allowed to exist inside a system.

It is not a product.  
It is not a philosophy.  
It is lawful structure.

Everything else is implementation.
